# Project Prometheus (Frontend Part)

> TL;DR - This is the source code for my course work and diploma

## Description

This project involves creating a LaTeX-enabled real-time chat room to send/receive mathematical data as visualized LaTeX code rather than plain text. Sending and monitoring of real-time messages is accomplished using GraphQL's subscriptions feature. The design of the application is done with Mantine components, which are combined in a nice and pleasant interface

> Initially the project was written in NextJS (w/ Pages router), but this "coolness" of the project turned out to be redundant for this case

## Project Stack

- Typescript 5
- React 18
- Vite 5
- Apollo Client 3 (w/ graphql-codegen)
- Zustand 4
- Katex (w/ react bindings)
- Mantine 7

## Foreword

This code is nowhere near perfect, but strives to be so
